#lists of tuples, lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and tuples of lists = sequences of sequences

'''USE TUPLES WHEN:
In some contexts, like a return statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.
If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string.
If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.
